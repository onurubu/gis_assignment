# gis_assignment
The repository of the data, code, and outputs of my assignment for the GIS module of Bio Honours

All of the code for this assignment was first tested in the R script gis_project_code.R. The full commented code for this assignment can be viewed there.

Map.rmd is the R markdown file that was used to generate Map.html.
Map.html is a web app including a interactive map as well as some background and context for the reason of the maps creation and use.

All of the data used for this assignment is in the gis_files folder. It contains the track site coordniates, the vegetation map, the image used, and the area of interest shapefile. This shapefile while unnecessary for the functioning of the final product, was kept included for demonstration purposes.
